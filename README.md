# School_District_Analysis.
## Overview of the school district analysis
  This analysis is focused on a set of schools and students that correspond to a specific school board evaluating students' abilities to perform in math class and reading skills.  The analysis exists on two levels: the school board level and the individual student level.  There is a detailed analysis of test scores from several perspectives including "private" versus "public" schools, school size, as well as age groups.
  There is also a problem with some of the data that requires cleaning.  This corresponds specifically to one school's grade 9 students who are suspected to be cheating on the standardized tests:  Grade 9 at Thomas High School.  This data must be considered and cleaning efforts must record the changes in the overall scores that are represented in the reports.


## Results
  There is some basic cleaning that was initially done with the data which includes removing all titles associated with students including Dr. and Mrs. for example.  
  When performed properly, the Math Percent drops and is recorded as 74.76 percent.  This was previously in the 80s due to the grade 9 recordings showing up higher in value and therefore boosting the average.  
## Summary
  Overall, the report is supposed to inspire the school board to make changes to the school, the number of students in future schools and what areas to make improvements to.
